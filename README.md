# Stock-Market-Pandemic-Analysis
Analysis of the three spikes in coronavirus cases during the year 2020 to see if the pandemic directly affected the stock market.
Included files are: R code, pdf poster for presenation, and the final report.
Note that the R code no longer functions correctly for the following reason:
  The NASDAQ datset has been changed since I initially worked on this project during Fall 2020.
  It no longer has a "sector" variable, which was replace by "Industry" variable. It is not an easy
  fix because the "sector" variable had high level categories such as Finance, Health Care, etc.
  The "Industry" variable has more detailed categories that makes just switching the variables in
  the code not possible. In the future, since this is historical data, I will download the portion
  of the dataset that I used so that the code will continue to function correctly even if the dataset
  is changed or updated in any way.
I will be updated this in the future so the code works correctly again.
